- Since we are asked to make a RESTful API without using the third party frameworks, we will most-likely find an initial solution using GitHub and shorten time
- A few examples are found, and we need to test them first.
- The one that works and has least code is: https://github.com/aditya-sridhar/simple-rest-apis-nodejs-without-frameworks
- First, we need to see if the code needs any cleanup, and upload everything to this repository.

- Now, we have to analyze what kind of calls we will make:
GET: List all recipes
POST: Add a new recipe
DELETE: Remove a recipe
POST: Update a recipe
POST: Manage individual ingredients

PUT is used to manage entire resource and will not be used for updating or adding

- Now, we have to analyze the kind on an object we will be using
The recipe object has:
ID
Name
Instructions
Ingredients

Since we are not using any database, all will be kept in a bucket array

- There are certain constraints we must include:
When adding, we do not include an ID
When updating, ID must be included and ID must exist in the array.
When managing ingredients, we must provide ID

-Since the DELETE call is missing from the code, I will have to add it
-I will assume that managing ingredients can be done with a simple update, therefore, we need to get the existing recipe, update ingredients and update recipe too.
-Since the code task is too simple, then it is most likely that ingredients is array or list, this means that we need to add a separate file/logic for managing ingredients that will be placed into the array or a list. For simplicity, I will go with the array.


Managing the ingredients has the following logic:
-All is done by updates
-Remove is just an update by null
-All ingredients are listed in array
-The update of a single ingredient is done by needle/haystack search
-The same POST request can have multiple JSON inputs

Request 1.
{
"updateAll":["potato","tomato",null]
}
- null is allowed

Request 2.
{
"searchFor":"oldIngredient"
"replaceWith":"newIngredient"
}
- null is allowed

Request 3.
{
"addIngredient":"someIngredient"
}
-null or empty is not allowed

--------------------------------------------
Testing:
For test-cases, it is better to use a third-party addon to make the REST calls. Otherwise, the code will get too ugly.
-Test the irrelevant/bad calls
-Test the null calls
-Test the bad data calls
-Test the add/remove/update/list
-Test the ingredient management using the same approach as above
