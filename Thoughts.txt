- Since we are asked to make a RESTful API without using the third party frameworks, we will most-likely find an initial solution using GitHub and shorten time
- A few examples are found, and we need to test them first.
- The one that works and has least code is: https://github.com/aditya-sridhar/simple-rest-apis-nodejs-without-frameworks
- First, we need to see if the code needs any cleanup, and upload everything to this repository.

- Now, we have to analyze what kind of calls we will make:
GET: List all recipes
POST: Add a new recipe
DELETE: Remove a recipe
POST: Update a recipe
POST: Manage individual ingredients

PUT is used to manage entire resource and will not be used for updating or adding

- Now, we have to analyze the kind on an object we will be using
The recipe object has:
ID
Name
Instructions
Ingredients

Since we are not using any database, all will be kept in a bucket array

- There are certain constraints we must include:
When adding, we do not include an ID
When updating, ID must be included and ID must exist in the array.
When managing ingredients, we must provide ID

-Since the DELETE call is missing from the code, I will have to add it
-I will assume that managing ingredients can be done with a simple update, therefore, we need to get the existing recipe, update ingredients and update recipe too.
